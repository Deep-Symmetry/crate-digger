= Analysis Files
James Elliott <james@deepsymmetry.org>

When rekordbox analyzes tracks there is some data that is too big to
fit in the database itself. We have already seen some of that (the
album art images, and of course the track audio is left in the
filesystem as well). The other analysis data is organized into “anlz”
files, whose path can be found in the DeviceSQL string pointed to by
index 14 in the string offsets found at the end of the corresponding
<<exports.adoc#track-rows,track row>>. These files have names like
`ANLZ0001.DAT` and their structure is described in this section.

The files are “tagged type” files, where there is an overall file
header section, and then each entry in the file has its own header
which identifies the type and length of that section.

Later player hardware added support for things like colored and
more-detailed waveforms. Apparently these were deemed too large to fit
in the `.DAT` files (probably due to memory limitations of the older
players downloading those files), so another file was introduced,
which shares the same base filename as the `.DAT` file, but uses an
extension of `.EXT` instead. Both kinds of file share the same
structure, but different sets of tags can be found in each.

[[file-header]]
== Analysis File Header

For some reason the analysis files store their numbers in big-endian
byte order, the opposite of the `export.pdb` database file. Field
names used in the byte field diagrams match the IDs assigned to them
in the
https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/crate-digger/blob/master/src/main/kaitai/rekordbox_anlz.ksy[Kaitai
Struct specification], unless that is too long to fit, in which case a
subscript abbreviation is used, and the text will mention the actual
struct field name.

The file itself starts with the four-character code `PMAI` that
identifies its format. This file format identifier is followed a
four-byte value, __len_header__ (at bytes{nbsp}``04``-`07`) that
specifies the length of the file header in bytes. This is followed by
another four-byte value, __len_file__, at bytes{nbsp}``08``-`0b` that
specifies the length of the whole file in bytes:

(draw-bottom)
----

The header seems to usually be `1c` bytes long, though we do not yet
know the purpose of the header values that come after
__len_file__. After the header, the file consists of a series of
tagged sections, each with their own four-character code identifying
the section type, followed by a header and the section content. This
overall structure is illustrated in the above diagram, and the
structure of the known tag types is described next.

[[file-sections]]
== Analysis File Sections

The structure of each tagged section has an “envelope” that can be
understood even if the internal structure of the section is unknown,
making it easy to navigate through the file looking for the section
you need. This structure is very similar to the file itself, and is
illustrated below.

.Tagged section structure.

(draw-box (text "len_header" :math) {:span 4})
(draw-box (text "len_tag" :math) {:span 4})
(draw-gap "Tag-specific content")
(draw-bottom)
----

Every section begins with a four-character code, _fourcc_, identifying
its specific structure and content, as described in the sections
below. This is followed by a four-byte value, __len_header__, which
specifies how many bytes there are in the section header, and another
four-byte value, __len_tag__, which specifies the length of the entire
tagged section (including the header), in bytes. This value can be
added to the address of the start of the tag to find the start of the
next tag.

There is not much value to __len_header__. If you study the structure
of each type of tagged section, you can see some sense of where the
“header-like stuff” ends, and “content-like stuff” begins, and this
seems to line up with the value of __len_header__. But because there
are important values in each tag’s header, and those always start
immediately after __len_tag__, it is simply easier to ignore the value
of __len_header__, and model the tag body as beginning at byte `0c` of
the tag. To show where the boundary occurs, in the diagrams that
follow, values that fall inside the byte range of the header are
colored yellow.

[[beat-grid]]
=== Beat Grid Tag

This kind of section holds a list of all beats found within the track,
recording their bar position, the time at which they occur, and the
tempo at that point. It is identified by the four-character code
`PQTZ`, which may stand for “Pioneer Quantization”. It has the
structure shown below. __len_header__ is `18`. The tag-specific
content starts with two unknown values, although Mr. Flesniak says
that _unknown~2~_ seems to always have the value `00800000`.

.Beat Grid tag.

(draw-box (text "len_beats" :math) [:bg-yellow {:span 4}])
(draw-gap "Beat entries")
(draw-bottom)
----

__len_beats__ at bytes{nbsp}``14``-`17` specifies the number of beats
were found in the track, and thus the number of beat entries that will
be present in this section. The beat entries come next, and each has
the following structure:

.Beat Grid beat.

(draw-box (text "b" :math [:sub "num"]) {:span 2})
(draw-box (text "tempo" :math) {:span 2})
(draw-box (text "time" :math) {:span 4})
----

Each beat entry is eight bytes long. It starts with _beat_number_, a
two-byte number (abbreviated _b~num~_ in the byte field diagram above)
which specifies where the beat falls within its measure. So the value
is always 1, 2, 3, or 4. This is followed by a two-byte _tempo_ value,
which records the track tempo at the point where this beat occurs, in
beats per minute multiplied by 100 (to allow a precision of
stem:[\frac{1}{100}] BPM). Finally, there is a four-byte _time_ value,
which specifies the time at which this beat would occur, in
milliseconds, when playing the track at its normal speed.

As noted above, there will be as many beat entries as __len_beats__
specifies. They continue to the end of the tag.

[[cue-list]]
=== Cue List Tag

This kind of section holds either a list of ordinary memory points and
loops, or a list of hot cues and hot loops. It is identified by the
four-character code `PCOB`, and has the structure shown below.
__len_header__ is `18`.

NOTE: Since the release of the Nexus 2 series of players, there is a
newer tag available that contains more information and supports more
hot cues, so you should check for that before loading this tag. See
<<extended-cue-list>> for details.

The _type_ value at bytes{nbsp}``0c``-`0f` determines whether this
section holds memory points (if _type_ is 0) or hot cues (if _type_ is
1). The number of cue entries present in the section is reported in
_len~cues~_ at bytes{nbsp}``12``-`13`, and we don’t yet know the
meaning of _unk_ at bytes{nbsp}``10``-`11` or __memory_count__ at
bytes{nbsp}``14``-`17`. The remainder of the section, from
byte{nbsp}``18`` through __len_tag__ holds the cue entries themselves,
with the following structure:

.Cue List entry.

(draw-box (text "loop_time" :math) {:span 4})
(draw-related-boxes (repeat 16 nil))
----

Each cue entry is `38` bytes long. It is structured as its own
miniature tag for unknown reasons, starting with the four-character
code `PCPT` (Pioneer Cue Point?), and its own internal four-byte
__len_header__ and __len_entry__ values (`1c` and `38` respectively).

If the cue is an ordinary memory point, __hot_cue__ at
bytes{nbsp}``0c``-`0f` will be zero, otherwise it identifies the
number of the hot cue that this entry represents (Hot Cue A is number
1, B is 2, and so on). The __status__ value at bytes{nbsp}``10``-`13`
is an indicator of active loops; if it is zero, the entry is a regular
cue point or loop. Active loops have the value 4 here.

The next four bytes have an unknown purpose, but seem to always have
the value `00100000`. They are followed by two two-byte values, which
seem to be for sorting the cues in the proper order in some strange
way. __order_first__ at bytes{nbsp}``1a``-`1b` (labeled _o~first~_ in
the diagram) has the value `ffff` for the first cue, `0000` for the
second, then 2, 3 and on. __order_last__ at bytes{nbsp}``1a``-`1b`
(labeled _o~last~_) has the value 1 for the first cue, 2 for the
second, and so on, but `ffff` for the last. It would seem that the
cues could be perfectly well sorted by just one of these fields, or
indeed, by their _time_ values.

The first “non-header” field is _type_ at byte{nbsp}``1c`` (labeled
_t_ in the diagram), and it specifies whether the entry records a
simple position (if it has the value 1) or a loop (if it has the value
2). The next three bytes have an unknown purpose, but seem to always
have the value `0003e8`, or decimal 1000.

The value _time_ at bytes{nbsp}``20``-`23` records the position of the
cue within the track, as a number of milliseconds (representing when
the cue would occur if the track is being played at normal speed). If
_type_ is 2, meaning that this cue stores a loop, then __loop_time__
at bytes{nbsp}``24``-`27` stores the track time in milliseconds at
which the player should loop back to _time_.

We do not know what, if anything, is stored in the remaining bytes of
the cue entry.


[[extended-cue-list]]
=== Extended (nxs2) Cue List Tag

This is a variation of the Cue List Tag <<cue-list,just described>>
that was introduced with the Nexus 2 players to add support for more
than three hot cues with custom color assignments, as well as
DJ-assigned comment text for each hot cue and memory point. It also
contains the information present in the standard Cue List Tag, so you
only need to read one set or the other.
https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-link#beat-link[Beat Link] tries
to use the extended tags if they are available, and falls back to
using the older ones if they are not.

Just like the older tag, this kind of section holds either a list of
ordinary memory points and loops, or a list of hot cues and hot loops.
It is identified by the four-character code `PCO2`, and has the
structure shown below. __len_header__ is `14`.

The _type_ value at bytes{nbsp}``0c``-`0f` determines whether this
section holds memory points (if _type_ is 0) or hot cues (if _type_ is
1). The number of cue entries present in the section is reported in
_len~cues~_ at bytes{nbsp}``10``-`11`, and we don’t yet know the
meaning of the remaining two header bytes. The remainder of the
section, from byte{nbsp}``14`` through __len_tag__ holds the cue
entries themselves, with the following structure:

----

Each extended cue entry has a variable length. It is structured as its
own miniature tag, starting with the four-character code `PCP2`, and
its own internal four-byte __len_header__ and __len_entry__ values.
While __len_header__ has the fixed value `10`, __len_entry__ is needed to
determine the length of the entry, so the beginning of the next one
can be located.

If the cue is an ordinary memory point, __hot_cue__ at
bytes{nbsp}``0c``-`0f` will be zero, otherwise it identifies the
number of the hot cue that this entry represents (Hot Cue A is number
1, B is 2, and so on).

The _status_ flag and mysterious sort order values present in the
older cue list entry header are simply absent here.

The first “non-header” field is _type_ at byte{nbsp}``10`` (labeled
_t_ in the diagram), and it specifies whether the entry records a
simple position (if it has the value 1) or a loop (if it has the value
2). The next three bytes have an unknown purpose, but seem to always
have the values `0003e8`, or decimal 1000.

The value _time_ at bytes{nbsp}``14``-`17` records the position of the
cue within the track, as a number of milliseconds (representing when
the cue would occur if the track is being played at normal speed). If
_type_ is 2, meaning that this cue stores a loop, then __loop_time__
at bytes{nbsp}``18``-`1b` stores the track time in milliseconds at
which the player should loop back to _time_.

Immediately after the loop time, at byte{nbsp}``1c`` is the single
byte value __color_id__ (labeled _c~id~_). This holds the color,
if any, assigned to memory points and loops. If it is not zero,
it is the ID of a row in the <<exports.adoc#color-rows,color table>>.
Hot cues do not use this value, and have their own color information
later in the entry.

The next seven bytes have an unknown purpose, but seem to have the
value `00`, except for the first byte which seems to have the value
`01`.

For entries that represent quantized automatic loops, information
about the quantized loop size is found in the values
__loop_numerator__ (labeled _l~numerator~_) at bytes{nbsp}``24``-`25`
and __loop_denominator__ (labeled _l~denominator~_) at bytes
{nbsp}``26``-`27`. The numerator and denominator represent the size of
the loop as a fraction of beats. So a four-beat loop would have a
numerator of 4 and a denominator of 1, while a half-beat loop would
have a numerator of 1 and a denominator of 2. Entries that are not
loops, or that are non-quantized, manually-positioned loops, will have
zeroes here. For cases where these are non-zero values, they are
always positive and powers of two. If the numerator is greater than 1,
the denominator will always be 1, and if the denominator is greater
than 1 the numerator will always be 1.

The quantized loop information is followed by __len_comment__ at bytes
{nbsp}``28``-`2b`, which contains the length, in bytes, of the
_comment_ field which immediately follows it starting at
byte{nbsp}``2c``. If __len_comment__ has a non-zero value, _comment_
will hold the text of the comment, encoded as a UTF-16 Big Endian
string with a trailing `NUL` (`0000`) character. So the length will
always be even, and (when non-zero) always at least 4 (a one character
comment followed by the trailing `NUL`).

WARNING: Some extended cue entries are incomplete, and their
__len_entry__ indicates they end before the comment, or include the
comment but end before the hot cue color information.
Code that processes them needs to be prepared to handle this,
and treat such partial cues as having no comment and/or hot cue color.

Immediately after _comment_ (in other words, starting __len_comment__
+ `1c` past the start of the entry) there are four one-byte values
containing hot cue color information. __color_code__ (labeled _c_ in
the diagram) appears to be a code identifying the color in which
rekordbox displays the cue, by looking it up in a table. The value
zero means to use the default green color which was the only color
supported by older CDJs, while the values `01` through `3e` identify
specific colors from the various 4x4 hot cue palette grids available
in rekordbox; their corresponding RGB colors can be found by looking
at the
https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-link/blob/3c41b3deb50bb5b347fbfe52aa7c9ae35c7637d3/src/main/java/org/deepsymmetry/beatlink/data/CueList.java#L513[`findRecordboxColor`
static method] in the Beat Link library’s `CueList` class. The next
three bytes, __color_red__ (labeled _r_), __color_green__ (labeled
_g_), and __color_blue__ (labeled _b_), make up an RGB color
specification which is similar, but not identical, to the color that
rekordbox displays. We believe these are the values used to illuminate
the RGB LEDs in a player that has loaded the cue. When no color is
associated with the hot cue, all four of these bytes have the value
`00`.

We do not know what, if anything, is stored in the remaining bytes of
the tag.

[[path]]
=== Path Tag

This kind of section holds the file path of the audio file for which
the track analysis was performed. It is identified by the
four-character code `PPTH` and has the structure shown below.
__len_header__ is `10`.

__len_path__ at bytes{nbsp}``0c``-`0f` holds the length of the file
path value, which makes up the entire tag body. _path_, which starts
at byte{nbsp}``10``, is a UTF-16 Big Endian string with a trailing `NUL`
(`0000`) character.

[[vbr]]
=== VBR Tag

This kind of section has not yet been explained, but it is believed to
hold an index allowing rapid seeking to particular times within
variable-bit-rate tracks. (Without such a structure, it would be
necessary to scan the entire file from the beginning to find a frame
starting at a particular time, which would be too slow for jumping to
memory points or hot cues deep within the track.) What is known of the
structure is shown below. The four-character code that identifies this
type of section is `PVBR` and __len_header__ is `10`.

This kind of section holds a fixed-width monochrome preview of the
track waveform, displayed above the touch strip on original nexus
players, providing a birds-eye view of the current playback position,

The purpose of the header bytes{nbsp}``10``-`13` is unknown; they
always seem to have the value `00100000`. The waveform preview data
begins at byte{nbsp}``14`` and is 400 (decimal) bytes long. Each byte
encodes one vertical pixel-wide column of the waveform preview. The
height of the column is represented by the five low-order bits of the
byte (so it can range from 0 to 31 pixels high), and the whiteness of
the segment is represented by the three high-order bits. Segments with
higher values in these three bits are drawn in a less saturated
(whiter) shade of blue.

[[tiny-preview]]
=== Tiny Waveform Preview Tag

This kind of section holds an even smaller fixed-width monochrome
preview of the track waveform, which seems to be displayed on the
CDJ-900. It is identified by the four-character code `PWV2` but
otherwise has the same structure as the larger waveform preview tags
shown <<waveform-preview-diagram,above>>. __len_header__ is still
`14`, and header bytes{nbsp}``10``-`13` also seem to have the value
`00100000`. The waveform preview data begins at byte `14` and is 100
(decimal) bytes long. Each byte encodes one vertical pixel-wide column
of the waveform preview. The height of the column is represented by
the four low-order bits of the byte (so it can only range from 0 to 15
pixels high), and no other bits are used.

[[waveform-detail]]
=== Waveform Detail Tag

This kind of section holds a variable-width and much larger monochrome
rendition of the track waveform, which scrolls along while the track
plays, giving a detailed glimpse of the neighborhood of the current
playback position. Since this is potentially much larger than other
analysis elements, and is not supported by older players, it is stored
in the extended analysis file (with extension `.EXT`). It is identified

__len_entry_bytes__ identifies how many bytes each waveform detail
entry takes up; for this kind of tag it always has the value 2.
__len_entries__ specifies how many entries are present in the tag.
Each entry represents one

Color detail entries are much simpler than color preview entries. They
consist of three-bit red, green, and blue components and a five-bit
height component packed into the sixteen bits of the two entry bytes.
Considering each entry as a two-byte big-endian integer, the red
component is the three high-order bits. The next three bits are the
green component, followed by the three bits of blue intensity, and
finally five bits of height. The two low-order bits do not seem to be
used. This is shown below:

[[three-band-preview]]
=== Waveform 3-Band Preview Tag

This kind of section holds a fixed-width three-band preview of the track
waveform, first displayed at the bottom of the display on CDJ-3000 players,
providing a birds-eye view of the current playback position, and
supporting direct needle jump to specific track sections. It is also
used in rekordbox itself. This is stored in a second extended analysis file
(with extension `.2EX`). It is identified by the four-character code
`PWV6` and has the structure shown below. __len_header__ is `14`.

__len_entry_bytes__ identifies how many bytes each waveform preview entry takes up; for this kind of tag it always has the value 3.
__len_entries__ specifies how many entries are present in the tag.
The three-band waveform preview data begins at byte{nbsp}``14`` and is 3,600 (decimal) bytes long, representing 1,200 columns of waveform preview information.

The three-band waveform preview entries are one-byte height values representing the mid-range, high, and low frequencies, in that order.
There is some scaling involved, and they seem to be drawn stacked on top of each other, with the lows in dark blue, the mid-range in amber, and the highs in white.

[[three-band-detail]]
=== Waveform 3-Band Detail Tag

This kind of section holds a variable-width and much larger three-band rendition of the track waveform, introduced with the CDJ-3000 (and also used in rekordbox), which scrolls along while the track plays, giving a detailed glimpse of the neighborhood of the current playback position.
This is stored in the second extended analysis file (with extension `.EXT`).
It is identified by the four-character code `PWV5` and has the structure shown below. __len_header__ is `18`.

__len_entry_bytes__ identifies how many bytes each waveform detail entry takes up; for this kind of tag it always has the value 3.
__len_entries__ specifies how many entries are present in the tag.
Each entry represents one <<djl-analysis:ROOT:track_metadata.adoc#frames,half-frame>> of audio data, and there are 75 frames per second, so for each second of track audio there are 150 waveform detail entries.
The purpose of the header bytes{nbsp}``14``-`17` is unknown; they may always have the value `00960000`.
The three-band waveform detail entries begin at byte{nbsp}``18``.

Three-band detail entries have the same structure preview entries, one-byte height values representing the mid-range, high, and low frequencies, in that order.
There is a different kind of scaling involved in drawing these, and it seems to be non-linear.
We have not yet found an approach that matches what we see in rekordbox.
The colors for low, mid-range, and high frequencies are the same as in the preview, but they are drawn on the same axis rather than being stacked.
The area where low and mid-range frequencies overlap is drawn in brown, and their pure colors are seen where there is no overlap.
The white high frequency is drawn last so it obscures any low or mid-range information underneath it.
Recordbox actually seems to do some light blending, but it is so dim that we have not bothered to reproduce it so far.

[[song-structure-tag]]
=== Song Structure Tag

This kind of section was originally used only in rekordbox Performance
Mode, but starting with rekordbox version 6 it also gets exported to
external media so CDJ-3000 players can use it to control lighting
looks. The section is identified by the four-character code `PSSI` and
has the structure shown below. __len_header__ is `20`, and as always
__len_tag__ is the length of the entire tag including the header. Many
thanks to https://github.com/mganss[Michael Ganss] for contributing
this analysis.

[NOTE]
====
The version that rekordbox 6 exports is garbled with an XOR mask to
make it more difficult to access the data. All bytes after _len~e~_
(bytes{nbsp}``10``-``11``) are XOR-masked with a pattern that is
generated by adding the value of _len~e~_ to each byte of the following
base pattern:

__len_entry_bytes__ identifies how many bytes each phrase entry takes
up; so far it always has the value `18`, so each entry takes twenty-four bytes. __len_entries__ at bytes{nbsp}``10``-`11` (labeled
_len~e~_ in the diagram) specifies how many entries are present in the
tag. Each entry represents one recognized phrase.

The value _mood_ at bytes{nbsp}``12``-`13` specifies the overall type
of phrase structure that rekordbox chose to represent the song, based
on its analysis of the audio.

The value 1 is a “high” mood where the phrase types consist of
“Intro”, “Up”, “Down”, “Chorus”, and “Outro”. Other values in each
phrase entry cause the intro, chorus, and outro phrases to have their
labels subdivided into styles “1” or “2” (for example, “Intro 1”), and
“up” is subdivided into style “Up 1”, “Up 2”, or “Up 3”. See the
<<phrase-labels,table below>> for an expanded version of this
description.

The value 2 is a “mid” mood where the phrase types are labeled
“Intro”, “Verse 1” through “Verse 6”, “Chorus”, “Bridge”, and “Outro”.

And value 3 is a “low” mood where the phrase types are labeled
“Intro”, “Verse 1”, “Verse 2”, “Chorus”, “Bridge”, and “Outro”. There
are three different phrase type values for each of “Verse 1” and
“Verse 2”, but rekordbox makes no distinction between them.

The purpose of the header bytes{nbsp}``14``-`19` is unknown.
__end_beat__ at bytes{nbsp}``1a``-`1b` (labeled _end_ in the diagram)
holds the beat number at which the last recognized phrase ends. The
track may continue beyond this, but will mostly be silence from then
on.

The purpose of the header bytes{nbsp}``1c``-`1d` is also unknown.

_bank_ at byte{nbsp}``1e`` identifies the stylistic bank which has
been assigned to the track by the user in Lighting mode. The value
zero means the user has made no assignment, and this is treated the
same as if “Cool” has been chosen. The values and their meanings are
listed in the <<track-banks,table below>>.

The final byte of the header also has an unknown purpose.

The phrase entries begin at byte{nbsp}``20``, and each has the
structure shown below:

The first two bytes of each song structure entry hold _index_, which
numbers each phrase, starting at one and incrementing with each entry.
That is followed by _beat_, a two-byte value that specifies the beat
at which this phrase begins in the track. It continues until either
the beat number of the next phrase, or the beat identified by _end_ in
the tag header if this is the last entry.

_kind_ at bytes{nbsp}``04``-`05` specifies what kind of phrase
rekordbox has identified here. The interpretation depends on the value
of _mood_ in the tag header, as is detailed the table below. In the
case of the “high” mood, there are numbered variations for some of the
phrases displayed in rekordbox that are not reflected in _kind_, but
depend on the values of three flag bytes _k~1~_ through _k~3~_ at
bytes{nbsp}``07``, `09`, and `13` in a complicated way shown in its
<<high-phrase-variants,own table>>. Our best guess as to the reasons
behind this is that the design of the lighting feature changed after
the first release, and they struggled to maintain backwards
compatibility.

We also noticed that when _mood_, _kind_ and the _k_ flags indicate a
phrase of type “Up 3”, additional beat numbers (which all fall within
the phrase) are present in the entry. These may indicate points within
the phrase at which lighting changes would look good; more
investigation is required to make sense of them. The number of beats
that will be listed seems to depend on the value of the flag _b_ at
byte{nbsp}``0b``: if this has the value 0, there will be a single beat
found in _beat~2~_ at bytes{nbsp}``0c``-`0d`, and if _b_ has the value
1 there will be three different beat numbers present, with increasing
values, in _beat~2~_, _beat~3~_ at bytes{nbsp}``0e``-`0f`, and
_beat~4~_ at bytes{nbsp}``10``-`11`.

_fill_ at byte{nbsp}``15`` is a flag that indicates whether there are
fill (non-phrase) beats at the end of the phrase. If it is non-zero,
then _beat~fill~_ at bytes{nbsp}``16``-`17` holds the beat number at
which the fill begins. When fill-in is present, it is indicated in
rekordbox by little dots on the full waveform. The manual says:

> [Fill in] is a section that provides improvisational changes at the
> end of phrase. [Fill in] is detected at the end of Intro, Up, and
> Chorus (up to 4 beats).
