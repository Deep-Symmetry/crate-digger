= Crate Digger
James Elliott <james@deepsymmetry.org>

You can find a Java library that can parse the structures described in
this research, and that can retrieve them from players’ NFS servers,
at https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/crate-digger

The project also contains Kaitai Struct specifications for the file
structures, which were used to automatically generate Java classes to
parse them, and which can be used to generate equivalent code for a
variety of other programming languages.

There are also ONC RPC specification files which were similarly used
to generate Java classes to communicate with the NFSv2 servers in the
players, and which can likely be used to generate structures for other
languages as well.
